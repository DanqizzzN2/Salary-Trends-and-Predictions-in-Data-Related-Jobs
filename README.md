The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains 9,355 job records spanning the years 2020 to 2023, providing a robust sample of salary trends in data-related roles over time. The dataset includes 9 columns of detailed information about job titles, categories, locations, experience levels, company size, work settings, and salaries, allowing a comprehensive analysis of factors that influence salaries within data science and analytics. 
The dataset includes key predictors of salary, such as experience level, job category, and company location, allowing for in-depth analysis and predictions. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover trends that are both data-driven and actionable, enabling informed decision-making for job seekers.
The target variable for our analysis is salary_in_usd, representing the annual salaries in USD. This variable was chosen because it directly reflects the earning potential of various data-related roles, allowing us to address the core question:** What factors influence higher salaries in data-related jobs?**
